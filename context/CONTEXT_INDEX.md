# FastEdge VSCode Extension - Context Index

**READ THIS FIRST** - This is your navigation hub for understanding the FastEdge VSCode extension.

---

## Quick Overview

**FastEdge VSCode Extension** is a VS Code extension that enables debugging and running FastEdge applications (Rust, JavaScript, and AssemblyScript) directly within the editor.

- **Compiles** code to WASM using language-specific build tools
- **Serves** applications locally on port 8181 using FastEdge-run
- **Integrates** with VS Code's debug interface (F5 to run)
- **Supports** dotenv files for configuration (env vars, secrets, headers)
- **Provides** commands for generating MCP server configs and Codespace setup

**Tech Stack**: TypeScript, VS Code Extension API, bundled Node server + webview UI, esbuild

## Search Patterns

**Don't read CHANGELOG.md linearly** - Use these search patterns:

```bash
# Find similar features
grep -i "command" context/CHANGELOG.md
grep -i "debugger" context/CHANGELOG.md

# Find bug fixes
grep -i "fix.*rust" context/CHANGELOG.md
grep -i "fix.*compile" context/CHANGELOG.md

# Find specific changes
grep -i "dotenv" context/CHANGELOG.md
grep -i "mcp" context/CHANGELOG.md
```

**Find feature documentation:**
```bash
ls context/features/ | grep -i "compiler"
```

**Search across all context:**
```bash
grep -r "Debug Adapter Protocol" context/
grep -r "FastEdge-run" context/
```

See `SEARCH_GUIDE.md` for more patterns.

## Token Efficiency Strategy

**Estimated token costs:**
- This file (CONTEXT_INDEX.md): ~250 tokens
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md: ~400 tokens
- Architecture doc: ~500-1,000 tokens each
- Feature doc: ~500-1,500 tokens each
- CHANGELOG.md: **Don't read** - grep only

**Typical task token usage:**
- Simple bug fix: ~750 tokens (this file + 1 feature doc)
- New feature: ~1,500-2,500 tokens (this file + 2-3 docs)
- Major refactor: ~2,500-4,000 tokens (this file + multiple docs)

**Compare to reading everything upfront: ~10,000+ tokens**

## Key Concepts

### Extension Components

1. **Extension Entry Point** (`src/extension.ts`)
   - Activates on startup
   - Registers commands and debug providers
   - Manages extension lifecycle

2. **Debugger** (`src/debugger/`)
   - `DebuggerServerManager` — forks bundled `dist/debugger/server.js`, manages port + lifecycle
   - `DebuggerWebviewProvider` — creates webview panel, bridges iframe↔extension messages
   - Per-app instances keyed by `configRoot`

3. **Compiler System** (`src/compiler/`)
   - Rust: Uses `cargo build` with wasm32-wasip1 target
   - JavaScript: Uses `fastedge-build` tool
   - AssemblyScript: Uses `asc --target release` (CDN/proxy-wasm apps)
   - All output to `<configRoot>/.fastedge/bin/debugger.wasm`

4. **Commands** (`src/commands/`)
   - Generate mcp.json
   - Run debugger (current file or package entry)
   - Setup Codespace secrets

5. **Configuration** (`src/dotenv/`, `src/utils/resolveAppRoot.ts`)
   - Dotenv file auto-discovery from `configRoot`
   - `fastedge-config.test.json` as app root marker + runtime config store
   - `resolveConfigRoot()` / `resolveBuildRoot()` for per-app isolation

### Key Terms

- **FastEdge-run**: Bundled CLI that runs WASM binaries locally
- **fastedge-config.test.json**: Per-app config file; also the `configRoot` anchor for server isolation
- **configRoot**: Directory containing `fastedge-config.test.json` — anchors per-app server + port file
- **buildRoot**: Directory containing `package.json` or `Cargo.toml` — anchors build CWD
- **dotenv hierarchy**: .env → .env.variables → .env.secrets (see DOTENV.md in root)
- **WASM**: WebAssembly - compiled output of Rust/JS/AS code
- **wasm32-wasip1**: WASI preview 1 target for Rust compilation
- **AssemblyScript (AS)**: TypeScript-like language compiling to WASM; used for CDN/proxy-wasm apps via `proxy-wasm-sdk-as`
- **asconfig.json**: AssemblyScript build config; presence at buildRoot is what triggers AS detection
